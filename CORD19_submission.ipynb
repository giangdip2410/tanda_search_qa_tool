    "The CORD19 challenge is an excellent proving ground for modern natural language processing. The challenge: to build machine-generated summaries of the Covid 19 research literature to assist in further research. The task is atypical of the average kaggle competition, as there are no training examples (other than a handful of example summaries) against which to train a supervised model, and no holdout test set against which to score submissions. Competitors must therefore develop unsupervised methods to generate the target output and define their own means of evaluating this output. This setting is typical of the broader challenges that nlp practitioners face \"in the wild\": choosing a latent space capable of representing the seemingly limitless variability of language data that fits a given task, and similarly designing an output space that meets the task specification.\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes a solution capable of generating the summary tables inf the format specified for the task. The approach is divided into search and summary stages, with a separate mdoel / tool for both of these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "The search tool identifies papers that answer a given research question in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regex search**: Articles of interest are identified by a simple regular expression keyword search of the article abstracts\n",
    "2. **Sentence-level TandA QA**: Abstracts identified in stage one are divided into sentences, and these sentences are scored based on the likelihood that they answer a generalised research question. Logits generated by the [Amazon Alexa Team's RoBERTa-based TandA model](https://github.com/alexa/wqa_tanda) are used to define these scores.  Those papers whose abstracts contain scores above a certain threshold are deemed to answer the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "Full text from each article identified in stage one is taken and analysed for the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study Design**: regular expressions highlight explicit mentions of a specific study design in the text, and other features that may relate to a given study design, for example statistical analysis terms (e.g. \"p<\", \"ci\") or the mention of modelling methods (e.g. \"regresion\", \"SVM\"). These are used to determine the most likely study design.\n",
    "* **Measure of Evidence**: [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)'s POS and NER tools are used to highlight word tokens relating to quantities of study subjects (e.g. \"patients\", \"participants\", \"samples\") or study locations mentioned in the text. Tokens identified in this process are cross-referenced with their overall frequency in the text; the quantities of tokens demed significant are returned as measures of evidence (e.g. \"100 patients\", \"1000 participants\").\n",
    "* **Challenge**: Similar to the second stage of the search process, a TandA question-answering model is used to score the likelihood that each sentence in the abstract text answers the question **\"what is the problem / issue / challenge?\"** (this can be customised by the user) - the highest scoring sentence is used as the **challenge** feature\n",
    "* **Solution**: Again, sentences from the full text of the paper are scored based on the likelihood they answer a question, which defaults to **\"what action should be taken?\"** - the highest scoring sentence is used as the **solution** feature.\n",
    "* **Addressed Population**: regular expressions are used to identify keywords relating to gropus (e.g. \"workers\", \"patients\", \"groups\") - POS tagging rules are then used to parse descriptions from the word tokens immediately following or preceeding these keywords to identify population descriptions (e.g. \"**mental health** workers...\", \"patients **with diabetes**\"). The most common of the group descriptions are identified as addressed populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the search / summarization process can be seen in each of the csv files in the output to this notebook. All have been prepared within the kaggle notebook environment. An example of search process is featured below, that produces the summary table for \"RESEARCH QUESTION\", with comments on the output for that task and a more detailed explanation of the search and summary results. Scripts used to build the summary tables for the other research questions can be found in the following notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Modes of communicating with target high-risk populations (elderly, health care workers)](https://www.kaggle.com/dustyturner/modes-of-communicating-with-target-communities)\n",
    "* [Management of patients who are underhoused or otherwise lower socioeconomic status](https://www.kaggle.com/dustyturner/management-of-patients-who-are-underhoused)\n",
    "* [What are ways to create hospital infrastructure to prevent nosocomial outbreaks and protect uninfected patients?](https://www.kaggle.com/dustyturner/hospital-infrastructure-to-prevent-outbreaks)\n",
    "* [Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance](https://www.kaggle.com/dustyturner/methods-to-control-spread-in-communities)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and the above can all be forked and run to reproduce the output results. The author's [tanda_search_qa_tool](https://github.com/samrelins/tanda_search_qa_tool) repository contains the code for the search and summary tools as well as various helper functions for preprocessing of the metadata and document texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please Note:** The results provided are an attempt to trade off specificity and accuracy of the summaries with quantity, and to demonstrate the results of this method un altered / curated. With a greater number of queries and less specific search criteria, many more potentially useful studies can be identified and included with these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* The approach works!: It is capable of parsing the entire CORD dataset to highlight the information required in the summary tables\n",
    "* Simple methodology: each stage of the task is based on a process that can be easily understood and explained to lay-people\n",
    "* Flexible: the different stages of the search and summary process allow for considerable flexibility, meaning results can be tailored to a wide range of research questions, beyond that of the current task specification\n",
    "* Visible: the tools are capable of producing visual cues to assist in refining the search process and explaining the results\n",
    "* Potential for fine-tuning: the TandA model is designed to be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal labled data. The simplicity of the sentence-level QA task offers the potential to produce labled training data to fine-tune the model and better recognise features of the covid-19 literature\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computationally intensive: the question answering elements of the search and summary process require individual sentences to be analysed by a RoBERTa base model and token-level POS and NER tagging for each paper in the summary tables. As a result, the search process is slow and would not be suitable as an on-demand search-engine based solution like a number of the task 1 submissions\n",
    "* Reliant on CORD dataset: the summary tool is unable to produce results for papers that are not featured in the json parses provided in the competition data. As such, a significant portion of promising results from the search process cannot be summarised and are not included in the results. Inaccuracies in the parsing can also cause some unusual features in the output tables.\n",
    "* Reliant on user input: producing summaries is still heavily reliant on user input to specify keywords, search questions that identify relevant publications, and parameters to define features in the summary data. In general, the model can't be thought of as independently generating the summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "As highlighted above, the TandA model was conceived as an answer to training question answering models in situations where task-specific training data is scarce. As such, this approach has potential for significant improvement by producing labled question / answer sentence pair examples from the covid-19 literature. Given that sentence-level QA is a binary classification task, it is relatively easy to procedurally generate training examples that can be used to fine-tune the model. This approach offers potentially large improvements to the quality of the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst developing this solution, attempts were made to use the summary examples provided in the competition data as training data, aiming to develop classification models to identify the study design and important features from publications. The small number of examples, and inconsistencies in the labeling prevented this from being a successful approach. As greater quantities of quality paper summaries are produced, this may become a viable means to parse information from the papers that has a greater basis on language understanding, and is less reliant on keyword tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes on Study Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant time was spent approaching the problem of identifying study design; so much so that it merits special attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "The author is not an epidemiologist, nor has any significant scientific research experience, and so is well versed in the specifics of medical research design. Given this, the example summaries and descriptions of the study designs were heavily relied upon when designing this part of the summary tool. This presented some considerable confusion given inconsistencies between assigned labels, the descriptions, and in several cases with the author's own description of their study design! Also, the descriptions did not seem to fit with research areas other than medicine / epidemiology - good examples were papers relating to biochemistry or molecular biology primary studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to simplify matters the following decisions were taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "* General Rule: the more specific study designs - **systematic review and meta-analysis, prospective / retrospective observational studies, cross sectional studies, and case series** -  were only assigned to a paper if the authors explicitly stated their study design\n",
    "* Expert Review: The description of the \"expert review\" study type states \"provides quantitative secondary data\" - this was contrary to the majority of such studies in the summary tables that included no such quantitative data. Moreover, the descriptions of the study designs did not allow for studies that were not a structured literature review, but did not include any numerical analysis. On this basis, a decision was taken to follow the examples in the summary tables and label non-numerate studies without a structured literature review component as \"expert review\"\n",
    "* Analytical Studies: a large number of papers in the corpora were clearly quantitative primary studies, with an experimental method, quantitative results and analysis, but did not fit any of the descriptions of quantitative studies. Given the authors did not specify any of the prescribed study designs, it did not seem appropriate to \"force a square peg into a round hole\" so to speak. As such, studies with these features were labled \"analytical study\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be stressed that these decisions were taken based on intuition and can easily be adjusted with more specific feedback and guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example - Combatting Resource Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a quick walkthrough of the usage and features of the search and summarizer tools, answering the research question **What are recommendations for combating/overcoming resource failures?**"

       "<h2><strong>q3mfoiu2 - Protecting Medical Trainees on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Frontlines Saves Us All</h2></strong><br><p>During a virtual news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said, “The chronic global shortage of personal protective equipment is now one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives.”To put a US face on the problem, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned the city on March 27 that they could run out of PPE and ventilators by April 3. Cantrell and 212 other mayors sounded the alarm weeks ago in a nationwide poll3 in which 91% reported a shortage of PPE in the cities they lead.The situation is so dire that PPE thefts have been reported at hospitals in South Carolina, the University of Washington in Seattle, and The George Washington University in the nation’s capital. Some healthcare workers have resorted to searching for masks at hardware stories, enlisting the help of sewing groups, and soliciting donations on social media.4 Many trainees are engaging their families to help in the search.In a display of ingenuity, medical students at The Johns Hopkins University are among an army of volunteers constructing 5000 plastic face shields daily for use by clinicians fighting COVID-19. From a warehouse in Baltimore, Maryland, owned by Johns Hopkins Health, gloved volunteers work 4-hour shifts cutting, gluing, and stapling using a process vetted by the school’s Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control/Prevention Office.Beyond the lack of availability of PPE is the issue of proper training in what to wear, when to wear it, and how to put it on and take it off properly. What can be washed and reused? Should hospitals require the gear and garments of clinical staff and trainees to be cleaned and laundered onsite to mitigate family and community spread? Should the N95 masks be worn during all patient interactions or only under specific circumstances? These are the burning questions on every clinician’s mind, and the absence of clear and consistent answers strikes fear in many trainees who are in the heat of the COVID-19 fight.<p><br><br><h2><strong>ka1vm9f2 - Double-Edged Spike: Are SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Tests Safe Right Now?</h2></strong><br><p>“Validation of new immunologic tests ain’t easy,” it’s been said; validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a particularly daunting task. While we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has now come to the limelight. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on health care resources. In the United States and many other countries, specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion (ie, “flatten the curve”). Scientific experts, governmental officials, and other professionals have publicly advocated for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially reenter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus. A test for detecting “immune” individuals who will not be reinfected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept, but is it realistic?The temporary easing of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing/use regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate, fast, and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory professionals, diagnostic companies, suppliers, investigators, and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments, test-compatible swabs, and nucleic acid extraction kits, ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results. As we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions (according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians), we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis: SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.<p><br><br><h2><strong>nzxjjh9f - Practice recommendations for lung cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ESTRO-ASTRO consensus statement</h2></strong><br><p>With great interest we read the recommendations by Guckenberger and colleagues [1] on radiation treatment of lung cancer patients in times of COVID-19, which were endorsed by ESTRO and ASTRO. The authors should be applauded for their timely and constructive guidance. Such recommendations are highly needed in these unprecedented times and we strongly support their initiative.Methodologically, the paper deals with two scenarios of a COVID-19 pandemic, in which (1) the risk to patients and care-workers needs to be minimized, and (2) reduced radiotherapy resources are available. The experts were given six different lung cancer cases, NSCLC and SCLC, in various TNM stages, and a Delphi process was used to reach consensus on different questions.In the second scenario, consensus amongst experts seems to have been reached unequivocally. In the event of (severely) limited resources, most experts opted to triage patients according to their potential for cure, the possible benefit of irradiation and their life expectancy, as well as to consider hypofractionation schedules in patients with stage I, III or IV NSCLC, and with limited stage SCLC. We believe these are sensible considerations and hence recommendations to make in times of reduced resources.In the first scenario, experts agreed to decide on a possible delay of treatment on the basis of the clinical cases. Most colleagues opted to not delay start of treatment in patients with stage III NSCLC or with limited stage SCLC. Also, the consensus was to not delay palliative treatment in NSCLC patients, but instead to use hypofractionated courses. Moreover, experts favored to recommend standard-of-care concomitant radiochemotherapy instead of giving sequential chemo-radiotherapy, or targeted agents or immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy.<p><br><br>"

The high morbidity and mortality at these facilities has been attributed to a combination of a particularly vulnerable population and a lack of resources to mitigate the risk.. During the first wave of the pandemic, the federal and state governments received urgent calls for help from ltc and residential care facilities; between march and early june of 2020, policymakers responded with dozens of regulatory and policy changes.. In this article, we provide an overview of these responses by first summarizing federal regulatory changes, and then reviewing state-level executive orders.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The policy and regulatory changes implemented at the federal and state levels can be categorized into the following four classes: 1) preventing virus transmission, which includes policies relating to visitation restrictions, personal protective equipment (ppe) guidance, and testing requirements; 2) expanding facilities’ capacities, which includes both the expansion of physical space for isolation purposes and the expansion of workforce to combat covid-19; 3) relaxing administrative requirements, which includes measures enacted to shift the attention of caretakers and administrators from administrative requirements to residents’ care; and 4) reporting covid-19 data, which includes the reporting of cases and deaths to residents, families, and administrative bodies (such as state health departments). .</strong>These policies represent a snapshot of the initial efforts to mitigate damage inflicted by the pandemic.. Looking ahead, empirical evaluation of the consequences of these policies – including potential unintended effects – is urgently needed.. The recent availability of publicly reported covid-19 ltc data can be used to inform the development of evidence-based regulations, though there are concerns of reporting inaccuracies.. Importantly, these data should also be used to systematically identify hot spots and help direct resources to struggling facilities.. </p><br><br><h3>Double-Edged Spike—Are Sars-Cov-2 Serologic Tests Safe Right Now?. - m2sg0dc9</h3><p>“validation of new immunologic tests ain’t easy,” it’s been said; validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a particularly daunting task.. While we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic, serologic testing for antibodies to sars-cov-2 has now come to the limelight.. Sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on healthcare resources.. In the united states and many other countries, specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion (ie, “flatten the curve”).. Scientific experts, governmental officials, and other professionals have publicly advocated for sars-cov-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially re-enter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus..

    "* **study design**: regular expression keywords are used to identify sections of the text where the author specifies their study design. If these are detected the study design is allocated accordingly. If not, keywords highlighting phrases commonly found in simulation studies are identified that can be confidently used to assign that study type. Remaining studies are queried for keywords relating to quantitative and experimental study designs - these are classified as \"analytical studies\" to differentiate them from the non-primary literature review type studies. The remaining studies are then classified as \"editorial\" if they are addressed \"to the editor\" or \"expert review\" otherwise.\n",

    "* **challenge / solution**: These sections make use of the same QA model as the search tool. Default questions **\"what is the problem / issue / challenge?\"** and **\"what action should be taken?\"** (minus the punctuation) are used to rank sentences from the paper text. The highest scoring answers are used in the respective sections as a high level summary. The challenge question uses only text from the abstract, as the abstracts are generally found to be a better summary of the issues the paper addresses - the solutions, however, are often better found in the full text. The tool does allow for custom challenge / solution questions should that be required, although the author has found the default questions to produce the best results in most cases.\n",

The [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) POS tags from the words immediately preceding and following these terms are then examined - particular grammatical constructs are looked for that identify descriptions of groups, for example \"critically ill patients\" or \"people experiencing economic hardship\". Terms that are found multiple times in the text, determined by a user-defined threshold, are then returned as the addressed populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **measure of evidence**: This also makes use of Spacy POS tags along with NER tagging. The named entities in the text are iterated through to identify cardinal numbers that relate to evidential quantities, such as\"respondents\", \"patients\", \"studies\". These are then compared with the overall mentions of these terms within the text to ensure relevance, and then reported as measures of evidence. Care is taken to eliminate numbers that form part of the referencing or structure of the text, and are not themselves quantities. \n",

       "<h1>Question: reducing demand or use of scarce low resources</h1><br><br><h3>The Hidden Victims Of Covid-19 Pandemic: Congenital Heart Disease Patients. - mzubhw88</h3><p>Tweet summary/ abstract: the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to the congenital heart disease community.. In egypt, a country with limited resources, hospitals have limited admission to urgent cases in order to preserve hospital beds and resources for covid-19 patients.. Only critical neonates with congenital heart disease (chd) are offered services at this time.. In the united states, elective procedures for chd patients have been canceled nationwide due to the pandemic.. Chd patients are hesitant to seek medical care for fear of exposure to covid-19.. While it is not yet known how many chd patients may be lost to follow-up or delay needed testing or intervention because of covid-19, we must begin to mitigate this impact on chd patients as the consequences will only contribute to the collateral damage of covid-19 on these hidden victims.. Organ transplantation has ceased, leaving critically ill patients without options.. A report addressing pitfalls in behavior during the covid-19 pandemic noted the uneven distribution of cases within and between countries will lead to inequalities in care (7) .. In this silent void of care, as international focus shifts to covid-19, chd patients are at risk of dying at home and/or developing complications from their cardiac condition.. They are among the hidden victims of the covid-19 pandemic.several themes have emerged from the literature regarding the impact of covid-19 on congenital cardiac programs (8) (9) (10) .. <strong style='color:magenta'>Limited resources such as hospital beds, ventilators, and blood products have resulted in difficult decisions regarding timing of chd surgery. .</strong>When healthcare resources become scare due to increased demand and must be rationed, a triage system becomes necessary (11) .. A triage system must be founded on transparency and based on committee decision, to avoid individual bias and singular responsibility for care allocation.. Shared decision making amongst medical and surgical teams is essential to implement timing of chd intervention when there are less resources.. General guidance for timing of chd intervention has been outlined by stephens eh et al.. (10) .. Many chd patients have excellent prognoses, if they receive operative intervention in a timely fashion.. Identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from intervention, either from a minimal intervention with maximal benefit or those who are most likely to suffer significantly from delayed care must be prioritized.. </p><br><br><h3>A Snapshot Of European Neurosurgery December 2019 Vs. March 2020: Just Before And During The Covid-19 Pandemic. - 09nr9dho</h3><p>Background: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2 or covid-19), which began as an epidemic in china and spread globally as a pandemic, has necessitated resource management to meet emergency needs of covid-19 patients and other emergent cases.. We have conducted a survey to analyze caseload and measures to adapt indications for a perception of crisis.. Methods: we constructed a questionnaire to survey a snapshot of neurosurgical activity, resources, and indications during 1 week with usual activity in december 2019 and 1 week during sars-cov-2 pandemic in march 2020.. The questionnaire was sent to 34 neurosurgical departments in europe; 25 departments returned responses within 5 days.. Results: we found unexpectedly large differences in resources and indications already before the pandemic.. Differences were also large in how much practice and resources changed during the pandemic.. Neurosurgical beds and neuro-intensive care beds were significantly decreased from december 2019 to march 2020.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The utilization of resources decreased via less demand for care of brain injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage, postponing surgery and changed surgical indications as a method of rationing resources. .</strong>Twenty departments (80%) reduced activity extensively, and the same proportion stated that they were no longer able to provide care according to legitimate medical needs.. Conclusion: neurosurgical centers responded swiftly and effectively to a sudden decrease of neurosurgical capacity due to relocation of resources to pandemic care.. The pandemic led to rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of responding centers.. We saw a relation between resources before the pandemic and ability to uphold neurosurgical services.. The observation of extensive differences of available beds provided an opportunity to show how resources that had been restricted already under normal conditions translated to rationing of care that may not be acceptable to the public of seemingly affluent european countries.. </p><br><br><h3>Navigating The Covid-19 Pandemic: Lessons From Global Surgery. - ajlmyjoe</h3><p>Surgeons practicing in high-income countries (hic) like the united states, which spends an estimated 765 billion dollars per year on unnecessary healthcare costs, are generally not accustomed to resource limitations.1 however, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has strained the usually robust healthcare system in hic.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Lack of adequate testing, small reserves of ventilators and global supply chain disruptions, among other causes, have led to shortages affecting care for critically ill patients – most notably human resources, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (ppe).2 this has transformed hospitals in hic to a “resource variable environment” with uncertainty of the supplies, intensive care unit (icu) beds, and staff available at any given time.although this challenging environment is novel for many providers in hic, these constraints are commonplace for providers in low- and middle-income countries (lmic). .</strong>Only 12% of the world's specialist surgical and anesthesia workforce practice in the world's poorest regions in africa and southeast asia, where a third of the world's population lives and the majority of the world's surgical burden lies.3,4 lmic also face a severe shortage of icu capacity, for example, uganda has only 0.1 icu beds per 100,000 population, compared with 20 beds per 100,000 in the united states.5,6 approximately 1 in every 4 hospitals in lmic do not have access to oxygen, rendering them unable to provide timely, basic care for many patients.3 at most hospitals in lmic, ppe shortages are the norm and essential care is provided by family members at the bedside.3,7 to overcome these and other daily challenges, lmic providers must often improvise, adapt, and innovate.. </p><br><br><h3>Covid-19 And The Raas—A Potential Role For Angiotensin Ii?. - 5ig907on</h3><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have wreaked havoc on healthcare systems globally.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The potential for spread of this highly infectious virus, which is more transmissible and lethal than influenza, has reached pandemic proportions and has left many clinicians scrambling to provide care with scarce resources, all in the setting of no curative treatment, immunization, or effective therapy. .</strong>Some candidate therapies include antivirals (remdesivir), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine), and vaccines (mrna-1273).. Moreover, as we learn more about this virus, we have begun to draw some noteworthy conclusions regarding currently available ancillary “therapies” which may affect the natural history of the covid-19 infection.. Some of these “therapies” may actually be the avoidance of certain medications, like ibuprofen.. Likewise, patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (arb) could be at a greater risk due to the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 enters the cell.. It stands to reason that therapeutics that act counter to this mechanism may confer protection.angiotensin (ang) ii, the novel vasopressor agent recently approved in both the usa and europe, may do just this.. While its role as a vasopressor in shock is well known, its role in conferring protection from covid-19, both to patients with shock and perhaps those without, is unknown and must be explored in this time of international crisis.. </p><br><br><h3>Covid-19 Pandemic: A Stress Test For Interventional Radiology. - l27omx7y</h3><p>Is currently struggling due to a lack of beds, material and human resources to meet demand and to cope with this global threat.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Consequently, the lack of anesthetic resources, including anesthesiologists, nurses, and drugs, reduces access to general anesthesia. .</strong>Thus, interventional radiologists and surgeons have to postpone all scheduled interventions (4) .. In the meantime, potential patients are no longer referred by the correspondents or the emergency department due to the limitation of hospital beds and consultations, patient's anxiety, and social distancing.. Concerns have been expressed about the risk of spreading sars-cov-2 during ir procedures (5) .. As with sars-cov-1 in 2002-2003, widespread and nosocomial transmission were expected due to the presence of the virus in the blood or stool and respiratory droplets (3, 6) .furthermore, the practice of ir during the outbreak remains challenging for most of the teams.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Human resources are limited during the epidemic because radiology technicians are often assigned to the intensive care units to perform chest x-rays or computed tomography (ct). .</strong>Attention was drawn to the need for creating separate pathways to protect negative patients and healthcare professionals from covid-19.. In institutions with several ir rooms, possibly located outside the operating rooms, referral of patients to a dedicated pathway for covid-19 patients is much easier than when the equipment is shared between diagnostic imaging and ir, like a ct-scan, or when a single ir room is shared between ir and other specialties.. Although some institutions are relatively protected from covid-19 compared to others, a new loco-regional organization would deserve to be evaluated if the epidemic remains at a high level for months.. </p><br><br><h3>Food Waste Management During The Covid-19 Outbreak: A Holistic Climate, Economic And Nutritional Approach. - 7cve1ckt</h3><p><strong style='color:magenta'>Improving the food supply chain efficiency has been identified as an essential means to enhance food security, while reducing pressure on natural resources. .</strong>Adequate food loss and waste (flw) management has been proposed as an approach to meet these objectives.. The main hypothesis of this study is to consider that the \"strong fluctuations and short-term changes\" on eating habits may have major consequences on potential flw generation and management, as well as on ghg emissions, all taking into account the nutritional and the economic cost.. Due to the exceptional lockdown measures imposed by the spanish government, as a consequence of the emerging coronavirus disease, covid-19, food production and consumption systems have undergone significant changes, which must be properly studied in order to propose strategies from the lessons learned.. Taking spain as a case study, the methodological approach included a deep analysis of the inputs and outputs of the spanish food basket, the supply chain by means of a material flow analysis, as well as an economic and comprehensive nutritional assessment, all under a life cycle thinking approach.. The results reveal that during the first weeks of the covid-19 lockdown, there was no significant adjustment in overall flw generation, but a partial reallocation from extra-domestic consumption to households occurred (12% increase in household flw).. Moreover, the economic impact (+11%), ghg emissions (+10%), and the nutritional content (-8%) complete the multivariable impact profile that the covid-19 outbreak had on flw generation and management.. Accordingly, this study once again highlights that measures aimed at reducing flw, particularly in the household sector, are critical to make better use of food surpluses and flw prevention and control, allowing us to confront future unforeseen scenarios.. </p><br><br><h3>Ags Position Statement: Resource Allocation Strategies And Age‐Related Considerations In The Covid‐19 Era And Beyond. - 42ockyir</h3><p>Covid‐19 continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk..

The study compares locations, routes, and means of transport between gmtl and user recall for 17 suitable users who were recruited during march 2020.. They were interviewed about their timeline using the timeline follow-back (tlfb) method which was then compared to their gmtl and discrepancies between both methods were addressed.. Interviewer conclusions were divided into categories: (1) participant recalled, (2) no recall (until shown).. Categories were subdivided by gmtl accuracy: [a] gmtl accurate, [b] gmtl inaccurate, [c] gmtl data missing.. A total of 362 locations were compared.. Participants recalled 322 (88.95% sd = 8.55) locations compared with 40 (11.05%, sd = 2.05) locations not recalled.. There were 304 locations found accurate on gmtl (83.98%, sd = 9.49), 29 (8.01%, sd = 1.11) inaccurate locations, and 29 (8.01%, sd = 0.54) missing locations.. The total discrepancy between gmtl and tlfb recall was 95 cases (26.24%, sd = 3.25).. Despite variations between users, google maps with gmtl technology may be useful in identifying potentially exposed individuals in a pandemic.. <strong style='color:magenta'>It is especially useful when resources are limited. .</strong>Further research is required with a larger number of users who are undergoing a real epidemiologic investigation to corroborate findings and establish further recommendations.. </p><br><br><h3>Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources In The Covid-19 Era And Beyond: Ethical Considerations Regarding Older Adults. - a3fz514d</h3><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) continues to impact older adults disproportionately with respect to serious consequences ranging from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk..

Today, more than 2500 years later, our country is amidst a new global pandemic afflicting both the available medical resources and our society's cohesive structure.infectious disease outbreaks are indeed a period of great uncertainty for societies.. <strong style='color:magenta'>In many countries, such crises can rapidly overwhelm the capacities of health care systems, forcing physicians to make difficult decisions about the allocation of available resources and even more, about human lives. .</strong>Therefore, critical decisions for public health protection have to be made promptly before the limited capacities of the medical system become further stretched leading to a system collapse.. During such distressing times, ethical questions concerning the allocation of medical interventions and medications or the utilization of health care resources often arise.health care delivery was markedly affected by the financial crisis in greece, which has been experiencing severe economic hardship and political turmoil since 2008.. The implemented fiscal control–centered policies and public health expenditure reductions of up to 43% between 2009 and 2014 have decreased the extent and the service quality provided by the hospitals in the greek national health care system (nhs).. 1\n",
       " during this time, it has been particularly challenging to continue providing quality lung cancer care to our patients.. The financial crisis has hindered our ability as health service providers to ensure the best possible results in accordance with the current scientific knowledge, using the most effective and modern surgical techniques and protocols with minor‐associated iatrogenic risk.. 1\n",

       "<h1>Question: allocating or prioritising care or scarce resources</h1><br><br><h3>Prioritisation Of Icu Treatments For Critically Ill Patients In A Covid-19 Pandemic With Scarce Resources. - xw9ur4hy</h3><p>Background: relying on capacity increases and patient transfers to deal with the huge and continuous inflow of covid-19 critically ill patients is a strategy limited by finite human and logistical resources.. Rationale: prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives.. <strong style='color:magenta'>It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them. .</strong>It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>Prioritisation strategy: prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level a) or saturation (level b). .</strong>Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: p1-high priority, p2-intermediate priority, p3-not needed, p4-not appropriate.. Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient's wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition.. Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease's natural history (icu days 7 to 10 for covid-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change.. For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount.. Perspective: prioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.. </p><br><br><h3>Covid-19 And The Raas—A Potential Role For Angiotensin Ii?. - 5ig907on</h3><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have wreaked havoc on healthcare systems globally.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The potential for spread of this highly infectious virus, which is more transmissible and lethal than influenza, has reached pandemic proportions and has left many clinicians scrambling to provide care with scarce resources, all in the setting of no curative treatment, immunization, or effective therapy. .</strong>Some candidate therapies include antivirals (remdesivir), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine), and vaccines (mrna-1273).. Moreover, as we learn more about this virus, we have begun to draw some noteworthy conclusions regarding currently available ancillary “therapies” which may affect the natural history of the covid-19 infection.. Some of these “therapies” may actually be the avoidance of certain medications, like ibuprofen.. Likewise, patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (arb) could be at a greater risk due to the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 enters the cell.. It stands to reason that therapeutics that act counter to this mechanism may confer protection.angiotensin (ang) ii, the novel vasopressor agent recently approved in both the usa and europe, may do just this.. While its role as a vasopressor in shock is well known, its role in conferring protection from covid-19, both to patients with shock and perhaps those without, is unknown and must be explored in this time of international crisis.. </p><br><br><h3>The Hidden Victims Of Covid-19 Pandemic: Congenital Heart Disease Patients. - mzubhw88</h3><p>Tweet summary/ abstract: the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to the congenital heart disease community.. In egypt, a country with limited resources, hospitals have limited admission to urgent cases in order to preserve hospital beds and resources for covid-19 patients.. Only critical neonates with congenital heart disease (chd) are offered services at this time.. In the united states, elective procedures for chd patients have been canceled nationwide due to the pandemic.. Chd patients are hesitant to seek medical care for fear of exposure to covid-19.. While it is not yet known how many chd patients may be lost to follow-up or delay needed testing or intervention because of covid-19, we must begin to mitigate this impact on chd patients as the consequences will only contribute to the collateral damage of covid-19 on these hidden victims.. Organ transplantation has ceased, leaving critically ill patients without options.. A report addressing pitfalls in behavior during the covid-19 pandemic noted the uneven distribution of cases within and between countries will lead to inequalities in care (7) .. In this silent void of care, as international focus shifts to covid-19, chd patients are at risk of dying at home and/or developing complications from their cardiac condition.. They are among the hidden victims of the covid-19 pandemic.several themes have emerged from the literature regarding the impact of covid-19 on congenital cardiac programs (8) (9) (10) .. <strong style='color:magenta'>Limited resources such as hospital beds, ventilators, and blood products have resulted in difficult decisions regarding timing of chd surgery. .</strong>When healthcare resources become scare due to increased demand and must be rationed, a triage system becomes necessary (11) .. A triage system must be founded on transparency and based on committee decision, to avoid individual bias and singular responsibility for care allocation.. Shared decision making amongst medical and surgical teams is essential to implement timing of chd intervention when there are less resources.. General guidance for timing of chd intervention has been outlined by stephens eh et al.. (10) .. Many chd patients have excellent prognoses, if they receive operative intervention in a timely fashion.. Identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from intervention, either from a minimal intervention with maximal benefit or those who are most likely to suffer significantly from delayed care must be prioritized.. </p><br><br><h3>Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources In The Covid-19 Era And Beyond: Ethical Considerations Regarding Older Adults. - a3fz514d</h3><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) continues to impact older adults disproportionately with respect to serious consequences ranging from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these issues have focused attention on how these resources are ultimately allocated and used. .</strong>Some strategies, for example, misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion that disfavors older adults in resource allocation decisions..

It is important to understand potential-use cases, current modeling strategies, and underlying assumptions of existing models, as more reliance will be placed on these tools over the coming months.since the beginning of the pandemic, multiple groups have published predictive mathematical models for covid-19, which vary substantially in the method of construction and in predicted outcomes.. The columbia university model, often cited by the new york times, is based on classic epidemiology theory with a seir framework.this model divides the population into 4 categories: susceptible, preinfectious (or exposed), infectious, and recovered (and presumed immune).. 1 another early model from the imperial college london, based on traditional epidemiology with bayesianbase monte carlo simulation, forecasted large numbers of british deaths in several projected scenarios and likely prompted a change in united kingdom policy.. 2, 3 the institute for health metrics and evaluation (ihme) model is based on matching regional and demographic data within the united states to worldwide locations further along in the epidemic and has thus far led to more optimistic models than either of the 2 mentioned above.. 4 ihme modelers believe death rates are more accurate than case rates.. By using information from countries that have already passed the peak of the pandemic, the ihme model requires fewer starting assumptions.. Little agreement exists the most important purpose of the models is to inform institutional and nationwide efforts to ensure patient safety.. Models of infection cases can inform the implementation of public policy measures designed to reduce the spread of the infection, such as social distancing and closure of nonessential businesses.. They can also help guide institutional efforts to care for patients by ensuring adequate hospital beds, ppe, testing resources, and staffing.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Predicting surges in infected caseloads can help determine if outpatient visits and surgeries should be scaled back to ensure adequate resources to care for the infected or allowed to grow to prepandemic levels. .</strong></p><br><br><h3>If Not Now, When? - 6kmbaswt</h3><p>The role of geriatric leadership as covid-19 brings the world to its knees.. The covid-19 virus is a ruthless enemy that knows no borders.. The measures that governments have been forced to take are devastating economic life and exposing major inadequacies in health care systems.. While the global village dissipates with the halting of international travel, people are facing lockdown in their homes in a desperate effort to curtail the spread of this virulent virus.. Not surprisingly, those who are older, sicker, frail, and socially isolated, are bearing the brunt of this attack.. The respiratory sequelae of covid-19 in the older population are severe, and many require mechanical ventilatory support in intensive care units.. Mortality is high, and for those who survive recovery is slow.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The need to treat a vast number of patients is overwhelming, resources are scarce, and difficult ethical decisions have to be made. .</strong>Triage criteria are being developed and are generally designed out of urgent necessity rather than being based on clear evidence-based scientific criteria (1).as the world struggles to cope with the worst viral pandemic of the last century, a recent report from spain shocked the reader with a new reality.what went wrong?. How did a tragedy like this happen in a country that was rated by bloomberg as the world's healthiest nation in 2019?. (3).we certainly are not here to judge, and this specific incident is under investigation by the authorities.. However, one may postulate regarding the reasons for such a tragic situation.. One must remember that this event occurred in a very unusual situation, where the rapid spread of disease has ruthlessly destroyed infrastructure as health care needs outstrip resources.. One may try to understand the personal perspective of health care workers pushed to their physical and mental limits in providing care to old and frail people at a time of crisis, while harboring their own concerns and fears.. Indeed, providing care for patients in an environment where the rapid spread of a highly infectious disease certainly places the health care worker at significant personal risk.. Moreover, in an atmosphere where the treatment of older functionally or cognitively impaired older people is considered to be futile, the door to abandonment is wide open.. </p><br><br><h3>Ethical Considerations For Allocation Of Scarce Resources And Alterations In Surgical Care During A Pandemic. - 8fhpsn4n</h3><p>The covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 is unprecedented in modern history.. Its effects on social behavior and health care delivery have been dramatic.. The resultant burden of disease and critical illness has outpaced the diagnostic, therapeutic, and health care professional resources of many clinics and hospitals.. It continues to do so globally.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The allocation of hospital beds and ventilators, personal protective equipment, investigational therapeutics, and other scarce resources has required difficult decisions. .</strong>Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the covid-19 crisis.. How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons?. What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making?. Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.. Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.. <strong style='color:magenta'>This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic. .</strong></p><br><br><h3>Developing Optimal Policies To Fight Pandemics And Covid-19 Combat In The United States. - ablounoq</h3><p>The world has faced many outbreaks and pandemics with hundreds of millions of deaths throughout its history.. Those epidemics are global health concerns and as well as serious economic issues.. <strong style='color:magenta'>There is certain need to allocate scarce sources efficiently to fight such epidemics in both personal and global dimensions. .</strong>Here we develop and propose two optimization models to maximize the total protection from any epidemic, pandemic or bioterror attacks; the first one is personal protection model or protocol and the other one is mass protection model that is inspired by the well-known weapon-target assignment problem of operations research.. <strong style='color:magenta'>These efforts are optimal allocation of scarce medical and economic resources to save millions of lives- gift of life. .</strong>We implement our general mathematical programming models with real-world data to fight the coronavirus pandemic for a person and the united states.. Our personal protection protocol provides 99.99% protection from covid-19 for an american through personal strategies when the mass protection model supplies 96.961% protection on average from coronavirus pandemic for the united states through countrywide policies.. The mass protection model which recommends general policy frame for health care policy makers could be applied for any epidemic at any level from county to city, to state and country as well as in global scale.. The mathematical relation between the personal protection protocol and the mass protection model also highlights the fact of unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno (one for all, all for one) for fighting epidemics- particularly the moving enemy, novel coronavirus which is double invisible due to its viral nature and the availability of the high level of asymptomatic cases.. Recognize the enemy, as protecting yourself means protecting people, love life, follow the rules and stay at home.. That is the greatest ever social impact.. </p><br><br>"

Ever since, the pandemic has spread widely across the world.. Covid-19 is not solely a health crisis, but rather a crucial issue affecting the social, ethical, and economic dimensions of the human life, governments, and countries (2) .in general, everyone is susceptible to a covid-19, while the elderly are more susceptible due to comorbidities and frailty (3) .. The highest mortality rate of the disease has been reported in the elderly, especially those with severe illnesses and immune deficiency.. Currently, no definite treatments or vaccines are available for covid-19, and recommendations mostly revolve around self-isolation and the observance of personal hygiene.. To the elderly with cognitive impairment, functional dependence or living alone, it might be difficult to follow instructions, stay updated on the news or detect the signs or symptoms of the infection.. Consequently, these individuals may be faced with challenges in communicating and explaining their pain or uneasiness, and the newly emerging pandemic becomes a profound health hazard in their cases (2, 4) .. Brooke and jackson have reported the risk of covid-19 mortality to be 3.6% in the elderly in their 60s and 8.0% and 14.8% in those in their 70s and over 80s, respectively based on the oxford covid-19 evidence service data (5).every pandemic may cause the excessive demand for healthcare facilities and systems, while also increasing the workload of healthcare providers.. <strong style='color:magenta'>On the other hand, the limited resources available to provide healthcare services to patients are a major challenge in this regard, which often emerges within the first days of the pandemic when the healthcare system is unexpectedly faced with a large number of patients without access to sufficient equipment, staff, and facilities. .</strong>As such, the healthcare system or patients may suffer numerous consequences due to unpreparedness (6) .. <strong style='color:magenta'>During this pandemic, some of the main issues faced by the healthcare system include the limited special equipment (e.g., ventilators, pulse oximeter, intensive care unit beds), overcrowding of patients in emergency departments, high infectivity of covid-19, and inability to isolate all the patients (7). .</strong>Under such circumstances and despite the deficiencies in the healthcare system, younger patients also have difficulty receiving medical care, and it seems that the elderly do not have the chance to compete with them in receiving optimal care.. </p><br><br><h3>Demand For Hospitalization Services For Covid-19 Patients In Brazil. - nqauuzw0</h3><p><strong style='color:magenta'>Covid-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. .</strong>In brazil, the first case was reported on february 26.. <strong style='color:magenta'>As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. .</strong>The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented.. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for china and italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, icu beds, and ventilators in early april, the most critical situation observed for icu beds. .</strong>Increasing the allocation of beds for covid-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week.. This suggests that solutions adopted by the brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to covid-19.. </p><br><br><h3>Covid-19 Pandemic: A Stress Test For Interventional Radiology. - l27omx7y</h3><p><strong style='color:magenta'>Is currently struggling due to a lack of beds, material and human resources to meet demand and to cope with this global threat. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>Consequently, the lack of anesthetic resources, including anesthesiologists, nurses, and drugs, reduces access to general anesthesia. .</strong>Thus, interventional radiologists and surgeons have to postpone all scheduled interventions (4) .. <strong style='color:magenta'>In the meantime, potential patients are no longer referred by the correspondents or the emergency department due to the limitation of hospital beds and consultations, patient's anxiety, and social distancing. .</strong>Concerns have been expressed about the risk of spreading sars-cov-2 during ir procedures (5) .. As with sars-cov-1 in 2002-2003, widespread and nosocomial transmission were expected due to the presence of the virus in the blood or stool and respiratory droplets (3, 6) .furthermore, the practice of ir during the outbreak remains challenging for most of the teams.. Human resources are limited during the epidemic because radiology technicians are often assigned to the intensive care units to perform chest x-rays or computed tomography (ct).. Attention was drawn to the need for creating separate pathways to protect negative patients and healthcare professionals from covid-19.. In institutions with several ir rooms, possibly located outside the operating rooms, referral of patients to a dedicated pathway for covid-19 patients is much easier than when the equipment is shared between diagnostic imaging and ir, like a ct-scan, or when a single ir room is shared between ir and other specialties.. Although some institutions are relatively protected from covid-19 compared to others, a new loco-regional organization would deserve to be evaluated if the epidemic remains at a high level for months.. </p><br><br><h3>Essential Role Of Patient Blood Management In A Pandemic: A Call For Action. - jx0zvhex</h3><p>The world health organization (who) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a pandemic.. Global health care now faces unprecedented challenges with widespread and rapid human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 and high morbidity and mortality with covid-19 worldwide.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Across the world, medical care is hampered by a critical shortage of not only hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds, but also impediments to the blood supply. .</strong>Blood donation centers in many areas around the globe have mostly closed.. Donors, practicing social distancing, some either with illness or undergoing self-quarantine, are quickly diminishing.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Drastic public health initiatives have focused on containment and \"flattening the curve\" while invaluable resources are being depleted. .</strong>In some countries, the point has been reached at which the demand for such resources, including donor blood, outstrips the supply.. Questions as to the safety of blood persist.. Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined.. As options dwindle, we must enact regional and national shortage plans worldwide and more vitally disseminate the knowledge of and immediately implement patient blood management (pbm).. Pbm is an evidence-based bundle of care to optimize medical and surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing and preserving a patient's own blood.. This multinational and diverse group of authors issue this \"call to action\" underscoring \"the essential role of patient blood management in the management of pandemics\" and urging all stakeholders and providers to implement the practical and commonsense principles of pbm and its multiprofessional and multimodality approaches.. </p><br><br><h3>Reallocating Ventilators During The Covid-19 Pandemic: Is It Ethical?. - 0ucanwx0</h3><p>The unprecedented covid-19 pandemic has challenged our society to evaluate our core values and ethics.. <strong style='color:magenta'>In a crisis like none other, health care facilities and physicians are now facing shortages of ventilators, beds, and even basic personal protective equipment. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>Many physicians are already facing a profound ethical dilemma: how to allocate these resources during shortages1, 2, 3, 4; with some hospitals, states and countries even having to establish policies on which groups of patients to prioritize in providing lifesaving treatment during the covid-19 crisis.5, 6, 7, 8\n",
       "bioethicists, thought leaders, and think tanks have formulated frameworks to provide guidance for physicians on how to allocate scarce resources during crises9, 10, 11, 12, 13. .</strong>Already, as seen in guidelines of resource allocation published in the united states 14 during this covid-19 pandemic, physicians are being asked to switch from doing what-is-best for the patient (patient-centric) to doing what-is-best for society (society-centric), a position that is both uncomfortable and unfamiliar for many american practitioners.among the many guidelines for public-health crisis, perhaps none is more unsettling than the guidelines that discuss not only how to ration ventilators, but also the guidelines that provide framework on how to reallocate ventilators (remove a ventilator from one patient to give to another)15.. Eminent bioethicists and thought leaders such as emanuel et al.. Have argued that during a crisis like the covid-19 pandemic, when demand far exceeds the capacity of a system, it is justifiable to preferentially “remove a patient from a ventilator or an icu bed to provide it to others in need” in order to maximize public benefit.. In the united states, this concept shakes many of us to the core, because it can be interpreted to go against our hippocratic oath.. Nevertheless, physicians across the globe are now faced with this very real dilemma during the covid-19 pandemic.. </p><br><br><h3>Management Of Surgical Lung Cancer Patients During The Covid‐19 Pandemic In The Financially And Resource Strained Greek Health Care System. - 198ol6yf</h3><p>In 430 bc, the city‐state of athens suffered a plague that caused it to lose the second peloponnesian war as well as one of its greatest statesmen, pericles, son of xanthippus.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Today, more than 2500 years later, our country is amidst a new global pandemic afflicting both the available medical resources and our society's cohesive structure.infectious disease outbreaks are indeed a period of great uncertainty for societies. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>In many countries, such crises can rapidly overwhelm the capacities of health care systems, forcing physicians to make difficult decisions about the allocation of available resources and even more, about human lives. .</strong>Therefore, critical decisions for public health protection have to be made promptly before the limited capacities of the medical system become further stretched leading to a system collapse.. During such distressing times, ethical questions concerning the allocation of medical interventions and medications or the utilization of health care resources often arise.health care delivery was markedly affected by the financial crisis in greece, which has been experiencing severe economic hardship and political turmoil since 2008.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The implemented fiscal control–centered policies and public health expenditure reductions of up to 43% between 2009 and 2014 have decreased the extent and the service quality provided by the hospitals in the greek national health care system (nhs). .</strong>1\n",

So far (june 1,2020), more than 6 million people around the world have been infected with the disease, and more than 370,000 have died.. 1 different conditions in the field of covid-19 compared to the previous conditions in different societies and the existence of the situation with novelty have created special perplexing conditions for many lay public and health care workers (hcws).hcws on the other hand, have many concerns about safety and personal protective equipment, assigned tasks in the inpatient department of patients with covid-19, the potential need to quarantine after work, concerns about getting infected and transmitting the infection to the family and stigma.. 2, 3 in the early days of the spread of the disease at the community level, there were other concerns for hcws.. <strong style='color:magenta'>Restrictions on financial and human resources and hospital beds, drug shortages and problems related to restrictions on the possibility of using special hospital facilities such as the use of intensive care units, in managing the situation, caused many problems. .</strong>4, 5 another problem that arose from the limited resources and spread of the disease at the community level was the use of physicians and other personnel of unrelated specialized disciplines in the field of covid-19 disease to help advance diagnostic and therapeutic processes.. This seemed inevitable to health policymakers.. The incident raised other concerns about the ability to manage the difficult conditions of hospitalized patients with covid-19 diagnosis for a group of staff.. 6 in this situation, in addition to the need to pay attention to the state of mental health among the masses, 7, 8 who may experience fear, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, suicidal thoughts and other related disorders, 9, 10 it is important to pay attention to the mental health status of the hcws of patients with covid-19.. </p><br><br><h3>Ethical Considerations Of Thoracic Transplant And Circulatory Support During The Covid-19 Pandemic: A Closer Look At Pulmonary Vascular Disease. - mqg6ndu0</h3><p><strong style='color:magenta'>The global consequences of sars-cov-2 infection have impacted hospital resources including the availability of medical personnel, general and intensive care beds and personal protective equipment (ppe), to name a few. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>In an effort to preserve ppe, personnel and inpatient beds, non-emergent procedures and surgeries have largely been electively postponed in many centers. .</strong>Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical consequences regarding thoracic transplant and circulatory support during the covid-19 pandemic..

The organ procurement and transplantation network (optn) has proposed that the major ethical principals applicable to promotion of equitable outcomes in organ allocation and transplant should include: \"utility\", \"justice\" and \"respect for persons\".. 2 in the broadest sense, \"utility\" takes into account the amount, and probability of benefit and risk, as it relates to the overall potential population impact, in this case related to specialized pah testing and therapy, as well as thoracic organ transplant.. \"justice\", on the other hand, describes the objective (fair) dissemination of these resources and/or thoracic organ transplant..

Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemics strain health systems and households.. Health systems in africa and south asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity.. Methods.. We investigated the impact of an unmitigated covid-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in karachi, delhi, nairobi, addis ababa and johannesburg.. We adapted a dynamic model of sars-cov-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns.. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use.. Findings.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated covid-19 epidemic. .</strong>A highly mitigated covid-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity.. Interpretation.. Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease.. </p><br><br><h3>Covid-19 And The Raas—A Potential Role For Angiotensin Ii?. - 5ig907on</h3><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have wreaked havoc on healthcare systems globally.. <strong style='color:magenta'>The potential for spread of this highly infectious virus, which is more transmissible and lethal than influenza, has reached pandemic proportions and has left many clinicians scrambling to provide care with scarce resources, all in the setting of no curative treatment, immunization, or effective therapy. .</strong>Some candidate therapies include antivirals (remdesivir), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine), and vaccines (mrna-1273).. Moreover, as we learn more about this virus, we have begun to draw some noteworthy conclusions regarding currently available ancillary “therapies” which may affect the natural history of the covid-19 infection.. Some of these “therapies” may actually be the avoidance of certain medications, like ibuprofen.. Likewise, patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (arb) could be at a greater risk due to the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 enters the cell.. It stands to reason that therapeutics that act counter to this mechanism may confer protection.angiotensin (ang) ii, the novel vasopressor agent recently approved in both the usa and europe, may do just this.. While its role as a vasopressor in shock is well known, its role in conferring protection from covid-19, both to patients with shock and perhaps those without, is unknown and must be explored in this time of international crisis.. </p><br><br><h3>Ethical Aspects Of The Covid-19 Crisis: How To Deal With An Overwhelming Shortage Of Acute Beds. - bpnxkc7a</h3><p><strong style='color:magenta'>The current outbreak of sars-cov-2 has and continues to put huge pressure on intensive care units (icus) worldwide. .</strong><strong style='color:magenta'>Many patients with covid-19 require some form of respiratory support and often have prolonged icu stays, which results in a critical shortage of icu beds. .</strong>It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not.. Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging icu admissions and treatments.. </p><br><br>"
